# snakes_cafe

This program will print a cafe menu and ask the user for their order.

The user must respond to the prompt with the exact name (case sensitive) of one of the menu items to add that item to their order. If they type an item that does not exit, the program will respond accordingly and wait for a valid item.

When the user types a valid item, that item will be added to the order and they will receive an alert that the item has been added. If they add more than one of an item, the grammar will change to indicate plurality.
